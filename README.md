# Project 13 - Ansible Dynamic Assignments (Imports And Community Roles)

In this project, I used Ansible dynamic assignments instead of static assignments like in the previous project. Instead of using `import` like in static assignments, `include` is used to signify dynamic assignments. 

Kindly check `project.md` for more information.
